# UniEvents

<p>My first ever freelance job and the biggest project I had taken on until then. Not my best design ever, I have improved greatly since
 then. However completing the site given its sheer scale and given the fact I was only one year into my degree was something
  to be proud on. The site is no longer live unfortunately so I have put the code here to look at.</p>
